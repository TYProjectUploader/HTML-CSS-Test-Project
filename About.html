          niche of titles won't be left out. <br> <br>

        <h1>Our story so far</h1>
        <p>
          There was once a FTP average gacha enjoyer named Tim. They were tempted by a demon into playing Mahjong Soul with the Love is War
          collaboration. They tried to find the most efficient ways to grind materials for rolling online but were annoyed by having to open
          multiple tabs for various websites. Nor was there any easy-to-understand guides or warnings for the hole they were about to jump into.
          As a result, they had some mishaps and violated their FTP life but still didn't get Hayasaka.<br><br>
          Thus they created Gacha Hole, where everything about the gacha games they played had all their information compiled. No gacha addict shall 
          ever have to waste precious seconds of grinding on searching for help only to find outdated guides and be left with no option but to whale.
          <br><br>
          Gacha Hole has sinced expanded to have a massive online community supported by both indie and established devs of gacha games. We now host 
          information on every existing anime gacha game and are constantly updated 24/7 by volunteers and veteran players.    
        </p>
        <h1>Our goals for the future</h1>
        <p>
          Moving forward, we plan to set up support programs and asylums for those in danger of being tainted or have been tainted
          by the same demon that once corrupted our founder. 
          <br><br>
          In addition,  we hope to offer online therapy by ex-gacha addicts for helping people that wish to climb out of the gacha hole
          at some point in the near future.
